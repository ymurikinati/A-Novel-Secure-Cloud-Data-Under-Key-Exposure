# A-Novel-Secure-Cloud-Data-Under-Key-Exposure

The project proposes a novel scheme called Bastion that ensures data confidentiality even in the event of key exposure and the adversary having access to almost all ciphertext blocks.
The project includes modules such as User, Owner, Admin, Time-based Key, and Chart, which contribute to user access control, encryption under access policies, administrative tasks, secure key generation, and data analysis based on user file downloads using charts.
Utilized advanced cryptographic algorithms, such as AES and RSA, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the cloud-stored data.
